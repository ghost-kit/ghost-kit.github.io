We are currently developing the basic functionality necessary to perform space weather science and forecasting tasks.  As more tools are written, their descriptions will be available here.\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on a preliminary build for release as a binary.  These binary files will be available on this page when they are ready.\r\n\r\n### Current Status\r\n- [x] LFM Reader\r\n- [x] ENLIL Reader\r\n- [x] CDAweb Toolkit\r\n- [ ] Coordinate Transform Utility\r\n- [ ] Space Craft Positions\r\n- [ ] Closed Field Line filter\r\n\r\n### Getting the Code\r\nThe code is available in its entirety from github.  You can get the code with the following commands:\r\n```\r\ngit clone git://github.com/ghost-kit/GHOST.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs soon as it is ready, you will be able to a master build, including all required dependencies, by issuing the command (on UNIX type systems):\r\n```\r\nmkdir ghost-build\r\ncd ghost-build\r\ncmake ../GHOST -DENABLE_ghost\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-43027623-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
