{"name":"GHOSTkit","tagline":"Geospace/Heliosphere Observation & Simulation Tool-kit","body":"### Welcome to the Geospace/Heliosphere Observation & Simulation Tool-kit\r\nGHOSTkit is an open source tool-kit plug-in designed to work with the @kitware ParaView project. This project provides space physics tools for analysis of model and space-craft data. We are currently developing the basic functionality necessary to perform space weather science and forecasting tasks.  As more tools are written, their descriptions will be available here.\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on a preliminary build for release as a binary.  These binary files will be available on this page when they are ready.\r\n\r\n### Current Status\r\n- [x] LFM Reader\r\n- [x] ENLIL Reader\r\n- [x] CDAweb Toolkit\r\n- [ ] Coordinate Transform Utility\r\n- [ ] Space Craft Positions\r\n- [ ] Closed Field Line filter\r\n\r\n### Getting the Code\r\nThe code is available in its entirety from github.  You can get the code with the following commands:\r\n```\r\ngit clone git://github.com/ghost-kit/GHOST.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nUntil binaries are available, you can build the tool-kit from source. Currently, the toolkit only builds on linux with the following instructions.  As the build system is in active development, these instructions will be changed as it successfully builds on other systems. The following instructions will allow you build the tool-kit, including all required dependencies, by issuing the commands (on UNIX type systems):\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git://github.com/ghost-kit/GHOST.git\r\ncd GHOST\r\ngit checkout v0.1.1.testing\r\ncd ..\r\nmkdir ghost-build\r\ncd ghost-build\r\ncmake ../GHOST -DENABLE_ghost=true\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-43027623-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
